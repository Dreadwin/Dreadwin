- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dreadwin
- 👀 I’m interested in basically just VQGAN. I don't know much about code. I'm an art person.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Colab's GPU usage limits 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing! I have such bad social anxiety oh my GOD.
- 📫 How to reach me? I politely ask that you do not.
